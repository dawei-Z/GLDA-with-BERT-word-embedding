Turn Off Smart TV Snooping Features,"Step 1) purchase raspberry pi  
Step 2) install and configure Pi-Hole  
Step 3) oogle over the thousands of blocked home base calls over the new few hours  
Step 4) slowly white list domains as you find out your smart tv has partnered directly with your app providers to make sure their information is sent to the right mining services or your tv app won’t work"

"IoT Image Capture & Transfer - No WiFi , Options?",Bunch of Wifi repeaters maybe? Possibly with Wifi Mesh   capability. You could even have them on a separate wifi network if you don't want to mix them up in your main IP space.
"IoT Image Capture & Transfer - No WiFi , Options?","You can use a SAT modem but they are expensive. 
If you can test GSM network coverage It is highly likely in that area you can find a signal. In that case try and send images using rf to a gateway that connects to the cloud via 2G.
That's how I would approach it. 
Cheers"
"IoT Image Capture & Transfer - No WiFi , Options?",You could check with your Operator if they are interested in running a test case for 5G/Small cells. Depending on the country you are in quite a few are interested for marketing purposes and it would allow you the necessary uplink capacity.
What is usually the gain on Lorawan antennas? (node),"Depends on how big you can make your node device. For a device the size of an iPhone, you should expect 3~0 dBi and about 40-50% efficiency. For a device the size of a golf ball though, probably -0~-3 dBi with 15-20% efficiency."

Recommendations please: cheapest board with ethernet **without** SD Card,"Someone posted an [ESP32 board from Lilygo](http://www.lilygo.cn/claprod_view.aspx?TypeId=21&Id=1308&FId=t28:21:28) the other day that's under $20 and has ethernet with PoE. While it does have an SD slot, it's not used for boot and doesn't even have to be enabled. 

I even had a discussion with some guy about how the Pi isn't always the best choice, even at the same price for projects where you don't want to boot a full Linux OS just to sample some data from a few sensors and push that over the network. 

Probably about as cheap as you can get for something that supports PoE and boots instantly from onboard flash."
New to IOT. want to start with a temp sensor on a raspberry,"Hi! I started my IoT journey a few years ago and my first advice would be to make your projects more ambitious incrementally. A Raspberry Pi is a perfect place to start, I would consider a Raspberry Pi 4 so you can have wired internet, WiFi and Bluetooth, in addition to great support for all the HATs and sensors you can connect to the GPIOs. 

I would start with a temperature sensor like a DHT11/DHT22, there are tons of tutorials connecting them and sending the data somewhere. You could start by sending that data somewhere (I like Azure IoT Central, but I'm mega-biased) through a wired connection or WiFi. Next you can implement LoRa, again lots of info online, but try not to tackle both issues at the same time would be my advice!

As for Blockchain & IoT, there are a few papers on the subject and why IoT might benefit from it. I work in a team where we have experts in both fields and we are currently not convinced of the benefits. If you have a strong working knowledge of Blockchain and how to interact (and write smart contracts for instance) for it, knock yourself out after you get the data out using any connection method.

Also, a microcontroller can handle some basic encryption depending on the specs, a Raspberry Pi (a mini computer, not a microcontroller) is definitely capable of handling it."
New to IOT. want to start with a temp sensor on a raspberry,"Depending how important LoraWan is to you, I could also help you get started with the platform me and my colleagues are building: https://www.gravio.com - but we use zigbee ... just let me know, I’m happy to help."
New to IOT. want to start with a temp sensor on a raspberry,"If you have access to WiFi network, all you need is a cheap ESP8266, DHT22 sensor, AWS account and this Micropython repo https://www.github.com/taskovskig/MicroPython/tree/master/AWS-IoT%2FESP8266"

Is transferring big files through a broker with MQTT a bad idea?,"Broker almost all have defined message size limits. They MAY be able adjust this size.  But it's clear from the fact that most all of them DO have a limit that large messages are potentially problematic.

One issue with moving files over MQTT is that you end up sending that file twice. once from source to broker and then a second time from broker to destination.

Second the broker is going to spend a lot of time ""shoveling"" data around, instead of doing what it's designed for which is to carefully route between publisher and subscribers.

I guess I think it's a bad idea."
Is transferring big files through a broker with MQTT a bad idea?,"I don’t think you want to use MQTT for that. It’s really meant for smaller data communication. I’m not really sure what you’re doing, but you could use MQTT to send info like the file url, then use that url to download the file over http."
Is transferring big files through a broker with MQTT a bad idea?,"Not completely sure but I think that MQTT can't be used to transfer data that is more complex than a bunch of characters
I mean, you can send data in JSON format but I don't kind you can send even a image
Maybe you can make a workaround by sending the URL where the receiver has to go to get such file"
Is transferring big files through a broker with MQTT a bad idea?,"Hosted brokers, like AWS IoT, have a much smaller limit (AWS has 128kB) which is one downside. If you were planning on running all the infrastructure yourself then maybe it'd be ok, though I'm not sure if brokers and/or message libraries would practically support messages that big.

Out of interest, what is the data? And how are you buffering so much of it on a small device with limited ram and flash?"
Is transferring big files through a broker with MQTT a bad idea?,Take a step back. What is in the files? Can that data be broken out into smaller chunks that would fit an MQTT use case?
Is transferring big files through a broker with MQTT a bad idea?,Yes you could do this especially if it was split into chunks. I would use a different protocol like HTTP POST.
Is transferring big files through a broker with MQTT a bad idea?,"Firstly, is it possible? Yes. You can theoretically slice anything up, send those slices as payloads and reassemble them at the other end.

Secondly, why wouldn't you? Many reasons. You would need to send this data with QoS 2 to ensure that the data gets there only once. This means every payload requires a whole bunch of messages to be sent. On top of that, the overhead for each message will increase the amount of data transferred significantly. Then there's that whole putting the pieces back together thing. Not a major issue but the messages might not necessarily arrive in the order you want them. You'll need to account for that.

tl;dr: It's not impossible but it's a hassle and very costly in terms of data.

Also:

""The other way I'm guessing this could be done is by implementing an HTTP client and then the mechanisms described in a REST API from said online service""

This seems like a sensible approach. HTTP/S is the perfect transport for files. You can use something like Node-RED to handle the difficult communication stuff between the device and the application. (sorry if I'm teaching you to suck eggs, don't know how ""into"" things you are)"
Is transferring big files through a broker with MQTT a bad idea?,"MQTT is not designed for those size payloads, and even if you can send such files, what would handle the files on the receiving end? MQTT in itself doesn't care what's in the payloads.

More solid choices:

* With server logic: HTTP
* Without server logic: (S)FTP

With server logic I mean something ""intelligent"" occurs once the file is uploaded."

Internet of Things (IoT) Devices are Evil - Why I Don't Put IoT Devices In My House,if he puts an evil emoji in the thumbnail it must be true
Internet of Things (IoT) Devices are Evil - Why I Don't Put IoT Devices In My House,"Ummmmmmm - Everything connects to the internet my dude. he didn't talk  about implementing controls or how to mitigate privacy violations. It's  kind of like telling kids about abstinence only sex education and not  mentioning birth control. Yes, not connecting or using IOT devices is  one way but, there are ways to prevent pregnancy \~ I mean privacy loss.   


So, cool topic that it was  recorded in his home on a Google connected computer but, at least other options should be mentioned."
Connecting to remote cellular (mobile) devices,"I’ve encountered this problem before and you don’t have great options outside of VPN or static IPs which, as you mentioned, are expensive. Your best bet is to have a regular outbound message from the device to your server, like a heartbeat, that allows the server to respond if it has something important to say. The downside to this approach is twofold: your device is always connected and using power and your device is using more data for this heartbeat.

Assuming power is not a major concern but data usage is, you can set up a pretty low overhead communication for your heartbeat. TLS uses a lot of data for overhead so avoid that. TCP even has a decent amount of overhead if you’re trying to be very frugal. For ultra low data heartbeats I would suggest UDP. You can send basically nothing except for the device ID and then your server can respond with its messages. If you’re concerned about security and/or concerned about ensuring messages are delivered (UDP does not have packet acknowledgement) then let your server respond with a simple instruction to your device to immediately follow up with a more robust call like HTTPS.

Edit: if you want more detail or want to discuss further you can DM me. Happy to help."
Connecting to remote cellular (mobile) devices,Perhaps you can trigger a session by sending a SMS to the device. The advantage is that it's simple. WireGaurd could be also interesting. Perhaps you can add each device as a peer to your WireGuard network. It's also fairly simple.
Connecting to remote cellular (mobile) devices,We had similar issue in one of the IOT projects because usually GPRS networks provide dynamic IPs. In one of the project we implemented [Piggybacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piggybacking_(data_transmission)) for commands.
Connecting to remote cellular (mobile) devices,"Do you mean that the devices' IP addresses are dynamic, not static? In any event, you can communicate back with them via their then-current IP as soon as they report in, right?

Can you build in logic at the device that detects when it's IP address has changed, and send you an IP-Changed message? If you can, then you can just save the last-seen-IP and use that to initiate a connection."
Connecting to remote cellular (mobile) devices,"MQTT is realtime, bidirectional, persistent, and nat-proof.  
Theres no need for VPN or static IPs.

  
also not sure what ""preserve the MQTT session"" means.  
do you mean ""send retained messages at QOS3""?

  
Sounds like maybe just learn how MQTT works."
Connecting to remote cellular (mobile) devices,"We have a customer in our white label IoT platform with a largish number of cell devices with a similar issue.  They report in via UDP on a schedule, we reach them ad hoc via SMS with control messages.  The device has several possibilities, but that's what they picked and easy for us to implement.  You have bi-directional possibilities w MQTT."
Connecting to remote cellular (mobile) devices,"Thank you all for the help and suggestions. You've given me two great ideas, the UDP ""knock"" from the device checking for updates, and possibly using SMS to request that the device call home! - I'll keep you posted."
Connecting to remote cellular (mobile) devices,"Have each of the devices subscribe to a specific MQTT topic, when it receives commands from that topic - it executes them.

&#x200B;

Alternatively, you can run an IRC client on each device such that all of them join a channel. This way you can monitor their presence, send commands (either individually or to groups of devices)."
Connecting to remote cellular (mobile) devices,Perhaps the best solution is a better Cellular carrier. Have you seen the new IoT Cell Sim and Data plans from Justworx? 10MB per month for 30 years at a fixed once-off cost of $20. Works on 230 networks in 105 countries. This is enough data to provide for a keep-alive message every 30 seconds (of 100 Bytes) to be sent to your MQTT server. You can learn more at [https://justworx.store/data.html](https://justworx.store/data.html)
Connecting to remote cellular (mobile) devices,"Mobile communication and the underlying network technology is not IP based. They provide IP as a layer on top of their base communication platform.

It’s neigh on impossible to accept incoming socket connections on a mobile device - without paying a service provider through the nose.

iOS, Android, and Blackberry before that hide this problem by the client making, and keeping alive a socket with a notification server. But that comes at a cost. One which was really evident when users began roaming across networks.

IoT cellular / mobile service plans, power consumption requirements and server load impose solution constraints. These push toward only maintaining and operating a communication channel between the IoT device and the server if / when needed. This in turn introduces latency, since you can’t call out to the mobile IoT device.

We could switch MQTT for any other messaging solution, even a simple socket solution, and we’d still have the same latency.

The root cause here is the mobile network’s underlying implementation.

I’m happy to discuss the problem in more detail, and will share any solutions I try out on /r/IoT."
"My friend got this in an Amazon mystery box he bought for $50. What could it be used for? It seems to have something to do with setting up a long range network of IOT devices, but I am not totally sure.","It looks like a 433MHz receiver over PCIe. A good example of it's use would be for your computer to receive LoRa data, which is a long range low data rate communications technology (think like WiFi, bluetooth, Zigbee but very low data rate and very long range). In my experience, it is often use for wide area sensor network kind of applications, but I am sure there are lots of other uses too!"

IoT data collection dashboard,"The solutions (and cost) vary greatly based on number of data points stored and types of computation. 

For example for my home, I connected my SmartThings hub to InfluxDB running on a docker container, then using Grafana to display graphs (also running on same docker node). 
This works well for a few hundred points a minute. Make sure you work on your retention. 


And one of my clients generated over 2M messages a second, and let's say, the solution is very different. 

I purposefully selected two extremes, and not require a bit of elbow grease.

What is Cellular IoT and Who is it For?,"I've worked on mobile phones, Cloud Infrastructure, 5G research, and now IoT systems. Maybe I'm just getting old, but we seem to continually be over engineering the solution. 

One such form of over engineering is using VPNs or establishing and maintaining a data link between the device and a control server. This costs time and money, both on the device, and on the server, and isn't needed at all.

Cellular communication is so much more than just establishing a data link. A good provider, can also give you access to information from the network about your device. A lot of which is just ignored by developers.

Maybe I'm just becoming that grumpy old engineer?! - But there seems to be a better way to do things."

Sigfox ultrasonic sensor send alert to sigfox cloud,"Hi! Can you elaborate? Which module you got? Comercial? DIY? Which sensor? How is module starting communication? Please update with more information and for sure someone could help you.
Regards."
Sigfox ultrasonic sensor send alert to sigfox cloud,Very easy to set up emails as a callback on the sigfox backend. But it will send everytime it receives a packet from the device. So you can either just include the sensor data in the email and read it each time to see if it has exceeded a threshold or write a callback that sends to an AWS lambda function that processes all the logic and can email or SMS you the result directly.
Making an impact in IOT?,"I think the best way is to get out and talk to people. Let them describe their day, follow them around, and see if you can think of anything that would help them.

An example:
A while ago I supported a thesis worker. A local university had been tracking the migration of an endangered fish. They inserted transmitters into fish and put a receiver at a strategic place in the river. The receiver logged timestamps of when each transmitter passed by. After a few weeks they pulled up the receiver and retreived the log from the SD card.

He thesis worker connected the receiver to a Sigfox transmitter, and transmitted the list of received IDs in near real time. A small change, but this made a big difference. The professor could now get email as soon as the migration started, and they could move the receiver upstream multiple times during the migration to get additional data.

I have many more examples like this, but they all start with someone working in their field (a ""domain expert"") talking to someone who understands IoT. The domain expert doesn't know what technical solutions exist, and the IoT person doesn't know what problems exist, but together they can identify areas of improvement."
Making an impact in IOT?,">The current use cases for IoT (outside of IIoT / Edge Computing) are a bit contrived or would be a hard sell to the cities, malls, stadiums, etc where the IoT solution would be deployed. Additionally, managing the costs and the latency requirements of the implementation would also be difficult.

Yes, when a new technology comes out, people always opine about the wonderful possibilities without regard for ""who will pay for that?""  (Just like people keep talking about ""mining resources on the moon to sell on earth"". The economics are never going to work, no matter how expensive the resource.)

That is why every successful technology finds a ""killer app"" where someone is willing to pay a lot to solve their problem. (i.e. Email caused a lot of people to get online.) It is rarely the use originally envisioned (the Web was for sharing technical documents, the telephone was for listening to concerts remotely.)

Only by thinking deeply about the economics, can you predict what will actually be successful. 

Saying ""cities, malls, stadiums, etc"" seems like you have been reading too much speculation. People making money in IOT right now are selling to factories, homes (Ring), retail stores, etc.

&#x200B;

>There doesn't seem to be a communication standard that encompasses this experience.

Yup, and there never will be. Even the internet isn't all HTTP (nor even all TCP).

That reminds me of people complaining about all the different computer languages: It's not a problem, because we can't settle on one human language either.

&#x200B;

>playing around with Arduino/Raspberry Pi over the last week and I'm struggling to come up with meaningful use case.

Yeah, it's going to take more than a week.

&#x200B;

>I've built an automated *irrigation system* and WiFi connected LED projects to get my *feet wet*

I see what you did there.

&#x200B;

>I'm still at a loss on how to contribute in a more meaningful way.  
>  
>Any suggestions on how to contribute to the IoT space as in independent contributor? 

You are tilting at windmills. That is like saying ""I just got a CS degree, how can I move the field of computing forward?"" Sorry, but that position requires decades of research.

If you want IOT to be more than a hobby, you're going to have to make money at it. If you are going to make money, you have to have a customer, and have to be able to solve one of their pressing needs.

It's that simple.

I know a guy who gets paid to put sensors on bridges and hook them up to the cloud because his customer wants early warning about floods. It all starts with the customer and their problem."
Making an impact in IOT?,"The most basic concept of IOT application is mostly related to monitoring. You can build a monitoring system (can be FDAS or BMS, etc.) then at the same time develop an app where it retrieves the data from that system. You can use cloud services for that too."
Making an impact in IOT?,I appreciate the thoughtful critique and thorough response. You’ve definitely made some excellent points and I know I need to spend more time sincerely learning about the space before I could hope to make any significant change. I think I may have naively been looking for some shortcuts. I’ll keep at it - thanks!
Making an impact in IOT?,"IoT, although having been around for a long time (10 years+), is all around you but the ""problem"" is that you only hear about the silly, contrived uses for it. That makes it sound like it's a solution looking for a problem, when that's far from the truth.

I led a project about 15 years ago at my company to put our very expensive machines online to enable remote diagnostics. In our case, it was very much a problem that needed to be solved, and after we did this, our service costs dropped dramatically (average of $1,000/day to send a service tech out). They dropped to the point that new customers had to pay higher service fees if they didn't let us put the machines on their network.

I honestly don't see any unmet needs here. 15 years ago when we did that project, we had to build everything ourselves because the few providers out there were too expensive and didn't offer the flexibility we needed. Today, I can stand up a simple IoT monitoring solution in an afternoon if I had to!

The businesses who know they need this tend to be able to find solutions because there are many providers already. I think the real problem is that there is little need for it in the **consumer** space and that's why it looks like a pointless toy to many. Industrial and Commercial IoT is definitely booming but those applications tend to be ""hidden"" from view. Your electric company probably doesn't need to roll a truck to get your meter readings any more because they can get them remotely, the big HVAC rooftop units on top of buildings will call home to their manufacturers when they need service, the number of people entering/leaving a mall or stadium is now known in real time, etc.

It's big and getting bigger. However, to the end user it's seen as a feature in a product, not a product in itself. i.e., when we're designing a new machine or system, we'll get a request to add Internet/cellular remote monitoring or control to it. It's expected as something that's built in, not an external add on."
IoE Vs. IoT: Which is the smarter business option in 2021?,"Wish I didn’t read it.  There is far too much emphasis put on names already. It is all the same stuff.

Critical flaws in embedded TCP/IP library impact millions of IoT devices across industries,Honest question. Wouldn't these vulnerabilities come to play only if iot device is connected directly to internet or if not behind a firewall? How would this be more dangerous than having a computer with no password connected to local network?
[Question]Contiki connectivity help,"Not at all. The FI-Ware agents can be configured to receive data via a range of methods. The [tutorial page](https://fiware-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/iot-over-mqtt/index.html) gives you an overview.


It is possible to send the data via MQTT, or other methods. There is a [MQTT client library for Contiki OS](https://github.com/esar/contiki-mqtt) available on github too.


I am guessing that since your using contiki your interested in a smaller footprint / power device, and the MQTT occasionally connected model might, therefore work better too.

Good luck!"
Looking for the best way to push commands to my ESP,Wouldn't MQTT be better for this? Sounds like exactly what it was designed for.
Looking for the best way to push commands to my ESP,[deleted]
Looking for the best way to push commands to my ESP,"MQTT protocol would be the way to go.  You will need to setup an MQTT Broker of some kind that both your ""Publisher"" and any ""Subscribers"" would connect to in order to pass along and receive commands/data.  My whole house runs on MQTT. I have a Docker server where my MQTT Broker runs, and a number of IOT related containers.  I have started to document my setup at [DIYSmartHome.io](https://DIYSmartHome.io) 

There are lots and lots of blogs/tutorials/etc. out there about using MQTT with ESP32 boards: [https://www.google.com/search?q=mqtt+esp32\&amp;oq=mqtt+ESP32](https://www.google.com/search?q=mqtt+esp32&amp;oq=mqtt+ESP32)"

Need iot solution :,"That's rather privacy invasive. That's simply not allowed in Europe. Damn, where is this? China? Do people really give their consent to this when come to study there?"
Need iot solution :,I suspect the social issues will far outweigh the IoT ones. Plenty of asset tracking software and hardware solutions out there. The questions will be around trust and security.  You give each student a Tag.. and somehow magically they all accept it.  What about when they leave the campus?  Perhaps they still have it and can be tracked?
Need iot solution :,"I would say it can't be done without the active cooperation of the students.  They would have to carry a device which would require charging at regular intervals, and would require them to not put the device in some sort of defeat device like a Faraday cage.  Unless you are in China, this will not go down well with students of today.  Actually, it would probably not go down well in China either, but they may well have no choice."
Need iot solution :,Are you referring to a contact tracing solution?

Need iot solution :,There are a number of Chinese companies providing this technology via video cameras. Unfortunately for you they are on the US entity list now and its a felony to buy their solution.
Need iot solution :,"You can use a combination of LoRaWAN, GPS, and WiFi positioning to do this fairly cheaply and with reasonable accuracy. Obviously this would require students to carry a small device and keep it charged but could potentially become a dual purpose 'id badge' or something.

If you needed a more polished, integrated solution developed feel free to DM me."
Need iot solution :,"Hi, I think one of the safest options considering privacy issues, would be the use of RFID. Place RFID readers at strategic points in the school, and then you can infer the location of students based on their last RFID check-in. Other options such as BLE/GPS will infringe on their privacy rights; although GPS would not work well indoors anyways."
Need iot solution :,[removed]
Need iot solution :,"The cheapest solution would require the students to take some kind of action like pressing a button when they enter or exit an area. You could consider some kind of reward system to motivate them. But it would probably be unreliable. 

Your actual use case would determine how reliable “location registration” needs to be. 

Any automated system would need the students to carry something around with them like an RF-ID tag. 

In both cases you have one or more sensors in each area that communicate with a central server.   

Each student has an unique ID that the room sensor uses to call either a register or deregister function on the server. The server stores the info in a database and serves a webpage where you can search by student or show a map, etc. 

There are privacy concerns to consider before the technology. It may turn out no one would accept the privacy terms, making the idea a non-starter. 

Sound like an interesting project though. Good luck!"
Need iot solution :,"Here in Norway it is very common to have employees issued an ID card with embedded RFID and mag strip. In order to open any of the doors in your office you need the card.

If I was tasked with the requirements outlined by the OP (not debating if it’s legal, ethical or desirable) I would issue a card to all students (they probably already have one?..) and place readers at all doors, entrances, exits common areas etc.

You said the you want to use a private network, are you running these servers on your network?

If yes did you register your device on the application server?

Are you aware that in LoRaWAN, the device does not connect to the gateway but with the application server.

ANY lorawan gateway (even the one owned by other people) within transmission range of your device will receive your encrypted message and forward the encrypted message to their network server (the gateway do not know the network and application keys.

How IOT device connect to secure wifi when the password is not in the code?,"There are several ways this can happen.

One way is the phone uses Bluetooth to talk to the device. Another is the that the device first acts like a wifi access point, and the phone temporarily connects to it (and not the normal network) and configures the device. Once that process is done the device and the phone re-connect to the the normal wifi network.

There are other ways as well, but I think those are the two most common (if the device itself is connecting to the secure network, if the device is using some sort of mesh network to talk to a hub, then the hub is connected to the wifi, that is a very different process.)"

LoRa vs xBee for a cheap (flood) mesh network without Internet access?,"There are quite a number of options for mesh networking.  And some are going to be easier to implement than others.

That said they're all going to be dealing with concrete physics/information theory as limits.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon–Hartley_theorem

For example. On one link increasing transmit power may increase the bandwidth.  But that ""signal"" will end as ""noise"" on another link, and actually reduce the bandwidth.

I would concentrate on ease of implementation over theoretical highest bandwidth.  It will be better to get something working over possibly having the best."
Separate router for iot devices?,"Generally not. A router from twenty years ago might have trouble with that many devices , but anything made in the last ten years that isn’t a travel router (airport express first and second generation, things advertised as travel routers) should handle above 50 devices without a second thought.

How much data do you think your devices are pushing? Most of the time they should be doing very little in terms of traffic, less than a modern web page.

I would say, set up a separate SSID and frequency for them, just to ensure they get a good connection. People who use 2.4ghz and 5ghz with the same ssid and have devices with only a 2.4 ghz radio find the devices sometimes lose connection trying to join the 5ghz radio at the router. 

Other people even set up VLANs just for the devices. Depending on what you’re doing that may be unnecessary."

Need Help - Chicken Farm Environment Monitoring,Hmmm check out Monnit’s stuff and see if they have the sensors you need.  They have some sensors that work over the ISM bands so they’re energy efficient. Those get paired to a gateway that acts as a cellular back haul.

Not everything is on cloud - How On-Premises Enhances Your Chances of IoT Success,"Excellent article. 

Besides, an already excisting company will mostly have a alreay a (on-prem) solution in place. Therefore, I think you have to make a distiction between 'new' and 'excisting' activities and companies as well. For excisting activities and companies, on-prem or a combined solution could be preferable.

Most companies have already on-premises in place. Even when the cloud could be the better solution, they don't want to throw away the on-prem completely. Because that would mean they would throw away the costs of their on-prem system. And maybe more important: the system right now is working in any case; a failure could be disastrous for the process itself or other processes involved. Cloud solutions could be used for new activities, while for the old ones, the on-prem could be used. 

Besides, mostly a company is working on a base capacity with their peaks. In the 'old' situation, a company needs to have its capacity based on those peaks, because processes otherwise would fail. With a combined on-prem/cloud solution, the on-prem would ensure the base capacity. The cloud can be used to adapt to the peaks"
I need to implement hundreds(500+ in 12 months) of RS232 reading devices,"A Raspberry Pi 3 ([https://www.amazon.com/s?k=raspberry+pi+3&ref=nb\_sb\_noss\_1](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=raspberry+pi+3&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)) and a serial HAT ([https://www.pishop.us/product/serial-hat-rs232/](https://www.pishop.us/product/serial-hat-rs232/)), pre-configured with a Node or Python program to take the Serial data, format it to your liking, and send it out to your service.  You should be able to either find or create a custom case and it becomes a 'plug & play' black box for your customers."
I need to implement hundreds(500+ in 12 months) of RS232 reading devices,"FWIW I think you should pursue multiple network options in parallel, but I recommend looking into cellular for your network choice. 

Needing to create a plug-and-play device because there’s a NAT or a 3rd party operator install is one of the reasons people choose to go that route."
CoAP protocol: Technical description,That's really cool! Are you planning on doing a post doing a short demo of it? It would be cool if you included the OBSERVE also!
Anybody knows RAKwireless? They just released a new LPWAN concentrator module with SX1302.,"Yes, I have met them at multiple conferences and I own one of their previous concentrator boards."
Platform for collecting and pushing data from and to IoT devices,Check out AWS IoT
Platform for collecting and pushing data from and to IoT devices,"If it is a big scale project, HTTP is going to be costly overhead , use MQTT

Have a look at open-source mozilla iot gateway"
Platform for collecting and pushing data from and to IoT devices,MQTT is perfect for this.
Platform for collecting and pushing data from and to IoT devices,"I have a similar home automation setup that I created using Django on heroku. My esp8266 devices post data to the server using http.

This allows me to store the data in a database and show it in dashboards on my website.

Typically Http is more resource intensive than mqtt; however, if your sensors are in deep sleep and being powered on infrequently it won't really matter"
Platform for collecting and pushing data from and to IoT devices,"For sure when it comes to IOT, event is your friend instead of a POST on a specific endpoint.

Queueing your events will isolate the production of events to their ingestion. MQTT is a well known protocol for that.

Every cloud providers (and most big network providers) now have some sort of IOT platform. depends on your money and the finality of your project. Is it a home usage project ? a product to be commercialised ?

You also have compagnies having already a solution out of the box where you can buy a license."
Platform for collecting and pushing data from and to IoT devices,"If you want to stick with something nice and RESTful like HTTP, CoAP is a really nice protocol. Have also heard good stuff about IFTTT from friends in terms of something to get your data to the right places. Alternatively, something like Flask + MongoDB is super easy to set up. I can DM tutorials if you want."
Platform for collecting and pushing data from and to IoT devices,"You can do it with MQTT, node js and mongo db for storing your data. But I will suggest you use any platform. That will be convenient. I've personally tried https://particle.io and https://grandeur.tech although Google and Amazon offer the same services but they're too difficult to configure."
Platform for collecting and pushing data from and to IoT devices,"you can get free data and cloud usage for small quantities like this on AWS, Azure, Google cloud. No need to home brew up something custom"
Platform for collecting and pushing data from and to IoT devices,"Sorry if this is random, but i spent a bit of time building an online endpoint to play with my devices (and send them commends).
Feel free to use it. And pm me if you have any questions.

Does rain affect Lorawan signals?,"Short answer for wireless will always be yes. 
For specifics, run your own test in target environment or look for papers (for example https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331583787_Measuring_Environmental_Effects_on_LoRa_Radios_in_Cold_Weather_Using_915_MHz p.44)."
Does rain affect Lorawan signals?,"In South Africa we have an uncapped 4G offering called Rain LTE, and ironically it loses quality whenever it rains."
Does rain affect Lorawan signals?,"Anything that your LoRA signal has to pass through to be received will degrade the signal.  If it has to pass through 10 rain drops, that won't be much of a signal loss.....if its a thunder storm and it has to pass through 10's of thousands of rain drops, then yeah, the signal will suffer."
LoRa for audio,"IIRC the FCC duty cycle for that frequency is around 1%. My guess is that this application would exceed that, yes?"
LoRa for audio,"https://www.iotsoundsensor.com/
and its datasheet

LoRa for audio,"We've tried this for our audio based device - at the compression rates required for low bandwidth transmission (<8kbps) you need to have a decently powerful processor (i.e. high end smartphone or laptop). It made it hard to do for a small cheap mobile device like ours  but if you're doing fixed point probably a lot easier. 

Overall capacity of simultaneous calls will also be a challenge if you are doing more than just point to point. Happy to discuss more over DM."
Alarm clock that can store some music and configurable by bluetooth,"If you want something simple, you could use an ESP8266 or ESP32 and an SD card MP3 player module - and connect it to WiFi. All you need to configure it would be a browser.

Or you can make it complicated and use the Bluetooth of the ESP32, and create an app for Android, ios and/or Windows/Linux/Mac."
Vibration sensor,Sounds like you need a microphone.
Vibration sensor,I would use an esp8266 wemos and a mpu6050 break-out module.  They are cheap and easy to get working with the arduino toolchain and libraries.    Youtube has videos explaining how to use a mpu6050 with an arduino MCU.
Vibration sensor,Have a look at petasense
