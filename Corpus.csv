23,IoTea #0: Top 5 IoT Use Cases for 2020,"Nice going! Liked the coronavirus joke, very topical. But most importantly, liked what you had to say about the subject matter. 

I'm always wary of the toy use cases of IoT, like automatic lights and novelty things which don't have much use to them. To me, the power of IoT is when you lean on the Internet side of these devices, and you start connecting many of them. That's why I'm impressed all 5 of your choices target the potential of connecting many devices and what they could help track and do.

If you're looking for ideas for next videos, how about a video about the current big players in the IoT world and what they're up to? I'll admit I can't track the news of IoT very well, so I'm not even certain what is currently possible and available in terms of tech."

35,FBI recommends that you keep your IoT devices on a separate network,"Was just working on implementing a telnet server on a microcontroller, using a 4G modem with a public IP address so it could be contactable.

Within 10 seconds of opening the port to listen for connections for the first time, it was getting connections that were not me.  It was port 23, so common for attacks, but wasn't expecting them so soon.

It would be pretty easy to DoS an IoT device ... at the very least, if it was exposed to the world.

Only having outgoing encrypted (TLS) connections and no listening sockets, should eliminate most attacks."

62,Amazon and Apple are quietly building networks that know the location of everything,"They are not the first to do this.   Google has sent around cars to not only map every road, but also WiFi access points. They are assembled into a database. So all you need are you your neighbors‚Äô WiFi AP entries and google can figure out where you are down to the house by looking up the access points in your vicinity.   When you do a find x near me, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs looking at, if GPS is not available.   

More recently, your bank may record your information to prevent fraudulent use of your credit card. 

There‚Äôs no reason why google should be the only company that invests in this technology.  More and better location capabilities could enable new services."

73,New chip for waking up small wireless devices could extend battery life,"To save a click:

 A new power saving chip developed by engineers at the University of  California San Diego could significantly reduce or eliminate the need to replace batteries in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and wearables.  The so-called wake-up receiver wakes up a device only when it needs to communicate and perform its function. It allows the device to stay dormant the rest of the time and reduce power use.  Credit: David Baillot/UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering  

[https://www.eurekalert.org/pub\_releases/2019-11/uoc--ncf110819.php](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/uoc--ncf110819.php)

&#x200B;

> The wake-up receiver is an ultra-low power chip that continuously looks  out for a specific radio signal, called a wake-up signature, that tells  it when to wake up the main device. It needs only a very small amount of  power to stay on and do this--22.3 nanowatts in this case, about half a  millionth the power it takes to run an LED night light."
74,New chip for waking up small wireless devices could extend battery life,"This is pretty interesting, but the choice of 9GHz limits its usefulness, doesn't it? It would have been more useful if its wake-up signature was in the common cellular IoT bands (LTE-M1 or LTE-NB bands for the various carriers). Even if that came at the cost of larger antenna and possibly more power requirements.

Or am I missing something?"

99,The Strategy of Selecting an IoT Platform (2019),"Interesting to see that, because of the infancy of IoT and the corporate fight for market share, it‚Äôs a dangerous time to pick a platform for fear of the platform falling behind.
I think this can be combated if you explain what your platform is to do generally then figure out the little bits specific to each platform when the time comes.

I think Edge computing has the obvious advantage for IoT over cloud computing for safety, privacy and data ownership reasons. In this respect I think Microsoft would have the advantage since they pretty much dominate the PC market, and I picture PCs being at the Edge. On the other hand I trust Amazon and Google more with Machine Learning with is also a critical part of the IoT."

"
102,"Discarded smart lightbulbs reveal your wifi passwords, stored in the clear",I need some clarification. Does this only apply to smart bulbs that use your WiFi connection for remote control directly? I have a sengled bulb that I control remotely through my hub using zigbee communication protocol.

117,Trying to understand IoT,"The issue is that IoT is a marketing term, used to group all the different problems and unique solutions that use embedded systems with networking technology. IoT is and was nothing new, and existed under different definitions before, such as M2M, ubiquitous computing, etc. The issue then became that people started looking for 'the one true platform', 'the one true protocol', 'the one true security method', etc. for IoT and started focusing on platforms/stacks/... that inevitably become more and more complex than they should be because of the huge diversity - and lost track of the diverse set of problems and unique solutions to these problems that actually need solving.

So your 10 year old example is IoT. I built one of the first TCP/IP driven systems with a 16-bit Renesas microcontroller almost 20 years ago - that too was IoT. And to answer your last question: it depends, and it's all IoT today."

119,Trying to understand IoT,"tl;dr

IoT is basically a blanket buzzword for tiny specialized computing devices.

I‚Äôd consider the sensors you used as IoT.

There are currently no standardized protocols for their communication nor for their security."
120,Trying to understand IoT,"Iot is basically anything that communicates over the internet or a local tcp/ip network other than a normal computer (desktop computer, laptop, general purpose server or maybe a phone - phones are a grey area).    So it sounds like what you did was IoT, the term just wasn't in use yet.

There are many protocols, some more standard than others. Or you can create your own.  Some systems have every little device on the network, others have a local hub on the network which then controls several devices.
Some systems send data over the internet to a server and back, some have devices talking to each other more directly. 

For example, when my phone is connected to LAN, it talks directly to my Phillips Hue hub (well, it goes through the router, but not to the internet).  And the hub talks to the Hue lights via Zigbee.  So this would work even if my internet connection didn't.

But if I'm away from home,  my phone can talk to Phillips' cloud, which then relays the commands to my bridge.  Or if I don't like using Phillips' cloud, I can set up port forwarding (and maybe dynamic dns) on my router, and connect to my hub with that."

122,Trying to understand IoT,"In manufacturing, it has been the shift from vertical solutions like Rockwell to more open platforms like Ignition, communication protocols like MQTT, and hardware like Wago and Opto22.  For me, Industrial Internet of Things is about bringing business processes closer to the manufacturing floor through working with facts and helping companies accelerate their own maturity with a smaller labor force .  It is a culture shift and the process of getting there is experimental and adhoc."
123,Trying to understand IoT,"You need a control unit for all IoT, in the case of a smart house, it would be your phone or tablet."
124,Trying to understand IoT,"Hey, like so many buzzwords, ""IoT"" is such a huge area that very few people know what it actually means, because it means different things to different people.

&#x200B;

I'd say that the work your were doing 10 years ago was definitely IoT, I'm doing similar things with similar sensors and using different backhaul, but it's still IoT.

&#x200B;

There are many ""standardised protocols"", from the usual TCP/IP over WiFi/GPRS/LTE through to specialised protocols such as LoRaWAN and NB-IoT, and it's often a case of finding the one that is most appropriate for your situation (we use LoRaWAN because it's long-range and farms are hard to cover with WiFi across multiple fields!)

&#x200B;

As far as your example is concerned, the answer is also ""it depends"".  If the Alarm Clock/Toaster/Coffee Machine are all made by the same manufacturer, then a hub may not be required, but in most cases there is an additional box that sits on the network and manages communication between all the devices that you own.  


I think the only thing I'd warn against is the hype around IoT and Blockchain being intrinsically linked.  They aren't.  Blockchain has its uses in \*some\* IoT projects, but by and large you don't need Blockchain in order to do IoT stuff!"

132,ESP32 IoT Devices Vulnerable to Forever-Hack,"If someone has physical access to your WiFi thermostat you've got bigger problems than this. Also, even tho this looks to require physical access to work, it's a good time to remind everyone that IoT devices should be locked up in restricted VLANs with no access to the internet. If it truly needs internet use some sort of gateway, MQTT or HTTP proxy or whatever, but do not put IoT devices directly on the internet."
133,ESP32 IoT Devices Vulnerable to Forever-Hack,"The primary problem is not ""physical access"", but with this sentence:

 ""The persistent nature of the attack is most problematic in a supply chain or re-sale situation where one party in the chain places a new payload into the ESP32 eFuse and fully compromises the device forever.""

ie. you cannot (easily) verify that the device you buy based on this chipset
is not compromised by the supply chain."

If not, then a nodeMCU is a good compromise of arduino library support with WiFi connectivity.  

Also note that the cheap sensors you will likely start out with do not have any particular guarantee as to fitness for your particular task.  More expensive sensors have testing and certification for operating under the conditions they will be used. That testing has probably not happened for that $1 sensor you bought on eBay.

231,"üåãüêÑ Technical ideas needed - Bali volcano eruption, tracking of livestock",">  we get good smartphones for $20 so it's strange that we can't find a tracking tag solution cheaper than $50

Economies of scale matter here. Building hundreds of thousands, or indeed millions of phones gets the end price of the phone down. At these scales, it also means higher integration is possible which can push costs down further. Tracking is much lower volume, so prices are higher per unit. Integration is limited, which leads to higher per unit costs as well. 

We have a test running at the moment which does GSM+GPS with a small solar panel on an ear tag. Preliminary results are good, but you won't have real time reporting, that is, to keep power consumption down the update interval needs to be carefully chosen.

Anything LoRa(WAN), or 'derivatives' like Haystack etc. will need infrastructure that usually isn't present at this time and requires you to build up towers etc. NB-IoT/Cat-M1 could be an option if it is deployed, but I'm guessing it won't be anytime soon in less developed countries even though it sits on cellular technology.

I believe that energy consumption on the tracker mostly comes from gps component. I would look for gps free geolocation solutions.  

Lora is currently the most optimal solution for connectivity - from the power consumption and range perspective. 

There are rumors that it will support gps free geolocation at some point.

Current price of Lora tags mostly comes from the cost of the modem on board. It will have to go down eventually. I am guessing at some point those tags to cost below 10 usd per piece.

Maybe it's worth to think about cheap rollout of the Lora network. Partner with energy companies for rollout?

236,"üåãüêÑ Technical ideas needed - Bali volcano eruption, tracking of livestock","I did a project involving triangulation of cattle with TIs line of wireless products. They have some far ranging features, that companies like Thingsquare take advantage of. Might be worth it to talk to them and see what their ideas might be. "
237,What has been your experience with LoRa?,"We did several projects around LoRa(WAN), the largest probably being a cattle tracking project. I want to start by saying here that, as usual, technology never is a be all end all thing. That means that when choosing a technology like LoRa it has to fit your solution. IoT these days seems to be pitting these different technologies against each other with the expectations that there will be a clear winner while in reality these different technologies each in their own form a key to solving very distinct problems.

Having said that, let me explain why LoRa(WAN) got picked for the cattle tracking: you can do this without GPS, thus saving power using TDOA ([time difference of arrival](http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Time_difference_of_arrival)). Now, this only works properly when you're doing cattle tracking on wide open plains, or places with minimal obstructions, or at least, in a non-urban environment. Doing something like a car tracker would be infeasible for many reasons: signal reflection in urban environments means you would need a LOT more base stations to be able to get to anywhere neat accurate TDOA to eliminate the GPS. If you control the environment however, and control your own base stations/towers like on a farm, you can create a very effective and pretty low cost solution to track the cattle. You wouldn't be able to do that with something like SigFox since you can't just create your own SigFox infrastructure.

Pain points with LoRa, as with many other new-ish IoT technology is that it's still very much in its infancy. It works, but it's not ideal. The software to run on the access points and server side is fine, but can be so much better. If you plan on deploying something on publicly available infrastructure, you're still very limited (the Things Network comes to mind, and a few cities here and there, but it's nowhere near ubiquitous). Same goes for SigFox, same goes for Cat-M1 and/or Cat-NB (NB-IoT). Too many decisions are made based on specific needs, without seeing the global picture of IoT capabilities. For example, Cat-M1 is being mostly deployed in the USA, while Cat-NB is mostly Europe. That means we're doing different product versions for different regions again. In addition to that, Cat-M1 can be used for non-static devices because it supports cell hand over, while Cat-NB can not. This means that a whole range of devices that are IoT but are mobile (like a car tracker) won't be able to properly use Cat-NB. LoRa will have similar issues: all these different infrastructure projects tend not to be compatible with each other, let alone roaming between them.

Fitting it into our stack is not a big deal because it's built with it in mind: we can support LoRa, SigFox, Cellular, Cat-M1, Cat-NB, and several others (some proprietary) on the same hardware and software platform. That is, we have a hardware device that can take a 2G,3G,4G module but could just as well have a LoRaWAN chip on it - it's just a swap on the feeder during production. Same on the software side: the platform doesn't care where the data comes from, and the parser for the data is a stand-alone piece that takes care of the details. [You can read more here about what we actually do](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-build-johan-dams).

Performance versus cost is pretty good with LoRa. Module cost is often considered higher in articles you read discussing this, but for the projects we've been involved with this was a non-issue. Data is 'free' in that you don't need to pay a third party, and the access points are pretty straight forward to build and are not really expensive. The ultimate goal however is to provide value to your customer: the hardware has an upfront cost, but if this cost offsets valuable time and other costs, it doesn't matter. 

Hope this helps. I could write a lot more on this, but it might make this post a bit too long...

238,"This is ridiculous - No content, just Business blather",Couldn't agree more.
239,"This is ridiculous - No content, just Business blather","I completely agree (except that apart from DIY I'd also be very interested in commercial development related posts).

However complaining won't change anything. 

How about this: those who reply in this thread pledge to post some content they feel is valuable over the course of this week.

I'll get started tomorrow morning. 

Let's see if we can get the ball rolling to shape this subreddit into something we perceive to be more valuable. 

Thinking about it, I'd also be happy about well-posed questions, bit just content-based posts. "
